My name is Dhaameen Hyder. I am from the UK but live in Australia. I have a legal background.
My career goals are to work towards a more technology focused role or maybe self-employment/startup foundation.
I chose Fintech as a career path because I work in finance, specifically in the digital space and this is directly relevant to the work I do. Plus coding and technology is something I've always had an interest in.
