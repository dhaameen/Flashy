# Unit 1 Assignment - FrankieOne Case Study

## Overview and Origin
---
COMPANY NAME, FOUNDING AND CORE IDEA
- Frankie One is an Australian Fintech founded in 2017 by Simon Costello and Aaron Chipper. 
- The founders of the company were originally looking to build the next great neobank but found customer onboarding processes were disjointed and clunky. They also found that avoiding penalties for non-compliance of KYC/AML rules came at the expense of customer experience. They decided to make onboarding easier and smoother for customers.
- FrankieOne provides a single API dashboard for managing onboarding obligations across KYC, AML, Biometrics, Fraud and Transaction Monitoring. 

COMPANY FUNDING
- Frankie was funded via seed funding and series A funding via venture capitalist investors. To date they received $23M AUD in funding.

## RESULTS
---
BUSINESS IMPACT 
- FrankieOne has had the following impacts to date:
    - It has connected to 350+ different vendors and data sources from ID verification, eKYC, AML, fraud monitoring and credit tools to enable data focused decisions and provide a single source of truth via it's single API.

    - It currently has investor interest from major financial figures such as Greycroft, Reinventure, Tidal ventures, Apex capital and Revolut.

MEASURES OF SUCCESS
- Companies in the EIDV space use pass rates as metrics for success.
- Unfortunately, due to the nature of the service provided EV pass rates were not available to determine FrankieOne's effectiveness nor it's comparison relative to competitors. Having said that, the growth of FrankieOne relative to other fintechs in the space and it's major partnerships with Blockchain Australia as well as clientele such as Afterpay suggest Frankie's success rates are high.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

RECOMMENDATIONS ON FURTHER PRODUCTS/SERVICES TO OFFER
- To complement FrankieOnes single API dashboard that allows for greater understaning of the onboarding/fraud environment being worked within, I would recommend the consideration of incoporating biometrics and liveliness checks into the program to allow for not just dashboard management of the companies onboarding processes but to work with the many databases Frankie is plugged into to provide realtime ID verification matching faces to documents to increase electronic verification matching rates.
- The benefits to offering this product would allow Frankie to leverage its current strenghts (vast database networks and multiple software compatibilities to enable a 'one stop shop' for onboarding and reduce the need for third party softwares outside of FrankieOne)
- This additional funcitonality would require further development of the AI an Machine Learning software to better understand the various facial features, plus an increased reliance on big data to conduct checks against databases to confirm matches.
